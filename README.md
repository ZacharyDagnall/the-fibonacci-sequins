A Fibonacci-Sequence-inspired variant of the popular game "[2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048",, which i guess was in-turn inspired by other [games](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2014/mar/31/threes-creators-2048-game-clone) like "Threes"? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Anyway this one was developed by Zak Dagnall.

Using in (substantial) part [this blog post](https://medium.com/tinyso/how-to-create-game-2048-in-javascript-reactjs-react-native-4588bfd136c9). Several bits of logic and code were incorporated and/or modified from this author's work.

This app was set up with Expo / React Native.

The idea started [here](https://gameboyzarcade.netlify.app/), in a web app by Zak Dagnall and [Pat-Tuszakowski](https://github.com/pat-tusza)

I also used [math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/getting_started.html) for a phi constant.
