A Fibonacci-Sequence-inspired variant of the popular game "2048",
developed by Zak Dagnall

Using in (substantial) part [this blog post](https://medium.com/tinyso/how-to-create-game-2048-in-javascript-reactjs-react-native-4588bfd136c9). Several bits of logic and code were incorporated and/or modified from this author's work.

This app was set up with Expo / React Native

the idea started [here](https://gameboyzarcade.netlify.app/), in a web app by Zak Dagnall and Pat Tuszakowski

i also used [math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/getting_started.html)

sequin images taken from [here](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/123086-colorful-sequin-vector-set) for now

note to self: if i publish this, i've gotta make it high-scorable. Nothing gets people going like clout. How could i store that backend though. Heroku can be so slow. Plus then fetches....
Maybe i can do that as the last thing before publishing.

- will only display top 10 scores and will only save to DB if you make it to the top ten

link to italian music to play while you play? opens a spotify playlist on your phone.

print the fibonacci sequence somewhere like under game board for reference? not sure.

golden rectangle game grid? (if it is playable in landscape-only then it will look better)

!! still needs animation !!

conditional font sizes depending on the num of digits of the number ?

how high should the numbers go? i'll also have to have that many different-colored sequin images
