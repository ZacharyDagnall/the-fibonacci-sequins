developed by Zak Dagnall

Using in (substantial) part [this blog post](https://medium.com/tinyso/how-to-create-game-2048-in-javascript-reactjs-react-native-4588bfd136c9). Several bits of logic and code were incorporated and/or modified from this author's work.

This app was set up with Expo and React Native

the idea started [here](https://gameboyzarcade.netlify.app/), in a web app by Zak Dagnall and Pat Tuszakowski

note to self: if i publish this, i've gotta make it high-scorable. Nothing gets people going like clout. How could i store that backend though. Heroku can be so slow. Plus then fetches....
Maybe i can do that as the last thing before publishing.
