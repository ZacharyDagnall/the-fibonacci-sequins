A Fibonacci-Sequence-inspired variant of the popular game "2048",
developed by Zak Dagnall

Using in (substantial) part [this blog post](https://medium.com/tinyso/how-to-create-game-2048-in-javascript-reactjs-react-native-4588bfd136c9). Several bits of logic and code were incorporated and/or modified from this author's work.

This app was set up with Expo / React Native

the idea started [here](https://gameboyzarcade.netlify.app/), in a web app by Zak Dagnall and Pat Tuszakowski

i also used [math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/getting_started.html)

note to self: if i publish this, i've gotta make it high-scorable. Nothing gets people going like clout. How could i store that backend though. Heroku can be so slow. Plus then fetches....
Maybe i can do that as the last thing before publishing.

- will only display top 3? 5? 8? scores and will only save to DB if you make it to the toppers

- oh-- for the leaderboard i could have it so that you only show up if your place is a fibonacci number. 4th place doesn't show up haha. Not sure what to do about the two 1s though...
  Like instead of just indexing the top 8 with fibonacci numbers, i can only take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 8th places or something. Maybe put first place twice for extra glory. Something like that.

link to italian music to play while you play? opens a spotify playlist on your phone.

print the fibonacci sequence somewhere like under game board for reference? not sure.

golden rectangle game grid? (if it is playable in landscape-only then it will look better)

!! still needs animation !!

sometimes pics are a lil laggy. Why is that? and how to fix?

change font styles too
