print the fibonacci sequence somewhere like under game board for reference? not sure.

golden rectangle game grid? (if it is playable in landscape-only then it will look better)

!! still needs animation !!

sometimes pics are a lil laggy. Why is that? and how to fix?

"hard mode":

- when you are at the title screen you can click the same play game button, then a modal appears asking if you want to play standard or challenge mode
- either way, you get a modal next which explains the rules briefly (if hard mode, explains the new aspect of it)
- for hard mode: under a certain probability, once the score is above a certain number (e.g. 100 or 150), a negative number from 3 to 144 may appear (bell curve probability for which number appears?). It is on a black sequin, and the font color is different. Maybe red. Red on black might look pretty tight.
- if a black sequin is present, the controls get reversed, which will be confusing. You can "vanquish" a black sequin by colliding it with another sequin of the OPPOSITE number (or greater? maybe?). When this happens, both sequins will disappear (because their sum will be zero), and the controls will return to normal (unless there is another negative sequin on the board, dun dun dun)

OR

- instead of black sequins with negative numbers, a famous mathematician (with a famous number? like Euler's constant?), (if mathematician, change font style for their tiles/sequins too?) or the black sequin with a famous non-Fibonacci number, like e and pi, etc.

if i make a hard mode i need to change a decent amount of stuff in the backend in order to accomodate two completely different leaderboards

am i happy with the border radius changing on Game Over buttons? should i incorporate that on some of the other buttons too?
