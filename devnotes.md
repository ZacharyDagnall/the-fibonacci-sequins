print the fibonacci sequence somewhere like under game board for reference? not sure.

golden rectangle game grid? (if it is playable in landscape-only then it will look better)

!! still needs animation !!

sometimes pics are a lil laggy. Why is that? and how to fix?

add a little menu toggler or something that tells how to play the game maybe? not sure what other options / things would go in there. Settings? There aren't many things to 'set'.
